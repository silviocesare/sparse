Trivial patches to use sparse in C++ code.
Probably won't work for you - I only extern'd stuff I use in my own projects.

Installing is a little tricky.. Build the original source first, then install, then
copy the patched files (include/) to the installation directory.

I have provided a precompiled mingw library.
